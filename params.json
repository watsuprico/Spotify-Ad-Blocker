In doing this, you are able to block some are all sites that Spotify is trying to connect with. By default the whitelist only allows Spotify's image sites, music streaming, and reconnecting to Spotify. The blacklist, (while not necessary when using whitelist), blocks known ad sites Spotify will try to connect to.\r\n<hr/>\r\n### How can I use Spotify Ad Blocker?\r\nSetting up Spotify Ad Blocker is easy.\r\n- Goto the [release page](https://github.com/watsuprico/Spotify-Ad-Blocker/releases/) and [download the latest release](https://github.com/watsuprico/Spotify-Ad-Blocker/releases/latest/). ![image](http://i.imgur.com/QZPSZsw.png)\r\n- Startup Spotify Ad Blocker\r\n  - Install the Titanium Root Certificate Authority (for the proxy)\r\n![cert](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15103907/d46d8dd2-157e-11e6-9557-b2bafae100b3.png)\r\n\r\n  - Open Spotify and goto Preferences > Proxy settings (under advnace settings) and change the proxy settings to match the ones in Spotify Ad Blocker *(by default: Type: HTTP | Host: 127.0.0.1 | Port: 80)*.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15103468/cbd34946-1579-11e6-959a-0e00f7bc1368.png)\r\n\r\n - Restart Spotify\r\n - And you're done!\r\n\r\n**Please note Spotify Ad Blocker needs administrator privileges.**\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n## Spotify Ad Blocker Features\r\n\r\n##### Fully customizable\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15102921/58a941ce-1573-11e6-983c-eb0ca007987d.png)\r\n\r\nSpotify Ad Blocker allows you to change *almost* any setting you could think about.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Monitor Spotify connections\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15102926/721f8244-1573-11e6-8d1b-ba628c39303b.png)\r\n\r\nYou can monitor connections made by Spotify by easily opening the console and viewing them.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Material design\r\nSpotify Ad Blocker was built utilizing a [material desgin look](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) to be more user friendly.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Out of the way\r\n![sab](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15102992/25408abc-1574-11e6-880e-216ee0056a37.png)\r\n\r\nYou can change the settings to allow starting up to the system tray to just run and forget about Spotify Ad Blocker.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Not only for Spotify\r\nYou can use this to tunnel any program you want through this proxy to manage and monitor their connections. *(But if you are using this as a system-wide ad blocker, let me teach you about a little thing called a [host file](google.com/search?q=host+file). It'll work better as a system-wide ad blocker)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known sites\r\n\r\nAd sites:\r\n```\r\naudio-sp-ash.spotify.com\r\naudio-fa.spotify.com\r\naudio-sp.spotify.com\r\naudio-ec.spotify.com\r\nheads-fab.spotify.com\r\nads.yahoo.com\r\nagkn.com\r\nrlcdn.com\r\nadnxs.com\r\ndoubleclick.net\r\nfastclick.net\r\npubmatic.com\r\ngooglesyndication.com\r\ngoogleadservices.com\r\ngoogletagservices.com\r\ncloudfront.net\r\nravenjs.com\r\ngvt1.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nGood sites:\r\n```\r\nscdn.co\r\nfbcdn.net\r\napresolve.spotify.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Editing the white list or the black list\r\nAll list check to see if that line x is in the current connection and base their actions off that \r\n##### Whitelist\r\nIf the current connection does **not** contain any of the addresses in the whitelist file, it will block it.\r\nFor example, if I try to connect to google.com, but that is not in a line inside the whitelist file, it will block that connection.\r\nHowever, if \".com\" is inside the white list, any site with \".com\" is not blocked.\r\nIf any connection includes x line in it, the whitelist will not block it.\r\n<hr/>\r\n##### Blacklist\r\nIf the current connection **does** contain any of the addresses in the blacklist file, it will block it. *(The opposite of the whitelist)*\r\n*(Blacklisted sites are disconnected before checking if they are whitelisted. ((If a blacklisted site is on the whitelist, it'll still get blocked)).)* \r\nFor example, if I try to connect to dropbox.com, but that is a line inside the blacklist file, it will block that connection.\r\nHowever, for say, if dropbox.com was not in the blacklist file, then it will not be blocked.\r\nIf any connection includes x line in it, the blacklist will block it.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n## Building and compiling\r\n- You'll need NuGet and VisualStudio\r\n - Open *`SpotifyAdBlocker.sln`*\r\n - Build *(`CTRL + Shift + B`)*\r\n - Copy allow files from **/SpotifyAdBlocker/include/** to **/SpotifyAdBlocker/bin/Debug/** *(where the .exe is located)*\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15103573/c428d8c2-157a-11e6-85b5-6f1f0adf8b3f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's it",
