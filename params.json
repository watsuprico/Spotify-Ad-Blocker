In doing this, you are able to block some or all sites that Spotify is trying to connect with. By default, the whitelist only allows Spotify's image sites, music streaming, and reconnecting to Spotify. The blacklist, (while not necessary when using whitelist), blocks known ad sites Spotify will try to connect to.\r\n<hr/>\r\n### How can I use Spotify Ad Blocker?\r\nSetting up Spotify Ad Blocker is easy.\r\n- Goto the [release page](https://github.com/watsuprico/Spotify-Ad-Blocker/releases/) and [download the latest release](https://github.com/watsuprico/Spotify-Ad-Blocker/releases/latest/). ![image](http://i.imgur.com/QZPSZsw.png)\r\n- Startup Spotify Ad Blocker\r\n  - Install the Titanium Root Certificate Authority (for the proxy)\r\n![cert](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15103907/d46d8dd2-157e-11e6-9557-b2bafae100b3.png)\r\n\r\n  - Open Spotify and goto Preferences > Proxy settings (under advnace settings) and change the proxy settings to match the ones in Spotify Ad Blocker *(by default: Type: HTTP | Host: 127.0.0.1 | Port: 80)*.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15103468/cbd34946-1579-11e6-959a-0e00f7bc1368.png)\r\n\r\n - Restart Spotify\r\n - And you're done!\r\n\r\n**Please note Spotify Ad Blocker needs administrator privileges.**\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n## Spotify Ad Blocker Features\r\n\r\n##### Fully customizable\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15102921/58a941ce-1573-11e6-983c-eb0ca007987d.png)\r\n\r\nSpotify Ad Blocker allows you to change *almost* any setting you could think about.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Monitor Spotify connections\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15102926/721f8244-1573-11e6-8d1b-ba628c39303b.png)\r\n\r\nYou can monitor connections made by Spotify by easily opening the console and viewing them.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Material design\r\nSpotify Ad Blocker was built utilizing a [material desgin look](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) to be more user friendly.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Out of the way\r\n![sab](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15102992/25408abc-1574-11e6-880e-216ee0056a37.png)\r\n\r\nYou can change the settings to allow starting up to the system tray to just run and forget about Spotify Ad Blocker.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Not only for Spotify\r\nYou can use this to tunnel any program you want through this proxy to manage and monitor their connections. *(But if you are using this as a system-wide ad blocker, let me teach you about a little thing called a [host file](google.com/search?q=host+file). It'll work better as a system-wide ad blocker)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Common errors\r\n#### Why are some ads playing?\r\nThis could be due to the configuration of Spotify Ad Blocker or Spotify has the ads cached\r\n- Try enabling only white listing and disabling the custom block message.\r\n- Try clearing the cache folder.\r\n- Try redownloading the [blacklist](https://github.com/watsuprico/Spotify-Ad-Blocker/blob/master/include/blacklist) and [whitelist](https://github.com/watsuprico/Spotify-Ad-Blocker/blob/master/include/whitelist)\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n#### Spotify is not connecting\r\nThis is usually because Spotify Ad Blocker is not running *(and Spotify is set to connect to it)* or a misconfiguration in the proxy settings.\r\n- Ensure that the proxy settings in Spotify match with those in Spotify Ad Blocker\r\n- Make sure Spotify Ad Blocker and the proxy is running \r\n -*duh*\r\nIf you are going to turn off the proxy or Spotify Ad Blocker, make sure you disable connecting to a proxy in Spotify.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n#### I changed settings about the proxy, but they're not working\r\nTry restarting the proxy, and if that doesn't work restart Spotify Ad Blocker.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n#### What is \"System.FormatException: An invaild IP address was specified\"?\r\nThis is when the IP setting is misconfigured.\r\nChange the proxy ip to 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known sites\r\n\r\nAd sites:\r\n```\r\naudio-sp-ash.spotify.com\r\naudio-fa.spotify.com\r\naudio-sp.spotify.com\r\naudio-ec.spotify.com\r\nheads-fab.spotify.com\r\nads.yahoo.com\r\nagkn.com\r\nrlcdn.com\r\nadnxs.com\r\ndoubleclick.net\r\nfastclick.net\r\npubmatic.com\r\ngooglesyndication.com\r\ngoogleadservices.com\r\ngoogletagservices.com\r\ncloudfront.net\r\nravenjs.com\r\ngvt1.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nGood sites:\r\n```\r\nscdn.co\r\nfbcdn.net\r\napresolve.spotify.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Editing the white list or the black list\r\nThe white/black list works by checking one line at a time and seeing if the connection Spotify is attempting contains that line.\r\nOn the white list, if the connection does not contain any of the lines, then it is blocked.\r\nThe black list, however, if the connection contains any of the lines, then it is blocked.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a line in the whitelist was `spotify.com`, any connection going to `spotify.com` would be allowed. *(Like `something.anotherthing.spotify.com/beepbeep/boopboop/thingy`)*.\r\nHowever, if that line was in the blacklist file, it would block any connection going to `spotify.com`.\r\n\r\nThey can also work on a wildcard bases. So if the whitelist had a line that contained `.com`, all `.com` sites would be allowed.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n## Building and compiling\r\n- You'll need NuGet and VisualStudio\r\n - Open *`SpotifyAdBlocker.sln`*\r\n - Build *(`CTRL + Shift + B`)*\r\n - Copy allow files from **/SpotifyAdBlocker/include/** to **/SpotifyAdBlocker/bin/Debug/** *(where the .exe is located)*\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10912095/15103573/c428d8c2-157a-11e6-85b5-6f1f0adf8b3f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's it",
